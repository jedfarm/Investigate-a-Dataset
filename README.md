# Physical characteristics of the ideal baseball hitter: A statistical glance to a century worth of history.

Throughout this project, we tried to answer the question of how the physical characteristics of baseball hitters relate to their performances. 

We used Python to pre-process and clean baseball data obtained from http://www.seanlahman.com (updated March 2, 2016). Since that time the website in question has changed its format, and the data is no longer available as .csv files. For that reason, we also included the original dataset here.

As the leading player performance stats we used:

- On-base percentage (OBP).
- Slugging percentage (SLG)
- Runs created (RC)

Then we studied how the batting hand, weight, and age influence the player's performance. 

We ended up finding interesting results, among others:

-  Switch hitters are not as good as we think they are
- Successful hitters are becoming heavier in recent decades
- Debut and retiring ages have remained stable over the years.
